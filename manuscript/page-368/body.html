<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: And do you extend your doctrine, Protagoras (as we shall further say), to the future as well as to the present; and has he the criterion not only of what in his opinion is but of what will be, and do things always happen to him as he expected? For example, take the case of heat:&mdash;When an ordinary man thinks that he is going to have a fever, and that this kind of heat is coming on, and another person, who is a physician, thinks the contrary, whose opinion is likely to prove right? Or are they both right?&mdash;he will have a heat and fever in his own judgment, and not have a fever in the physician's judgment?</p></div> </div>
