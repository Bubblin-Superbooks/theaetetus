I have omitted, for the sake of convenience, the interlocutory words 'I said,' 'I remarked,' which he used when he spoke of himself, and again, 'he agreed,' or 'disagreed,' in the answer, lest the repetition of them should be troublesome.</p><p>TERPSION: Quite right, Euclid.</p><p>EUCLID: And now, boy, you may take the roll and read.</p><p>EUCLID'S SERVANT READS.</p></div> </div>
