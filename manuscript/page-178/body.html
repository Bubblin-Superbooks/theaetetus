<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Returning to the senses we may briefly consider two questions&mdash;first their relation to the mind, secondly, their relation to outward objects:&mdash;</p><p>1. The senses are not merely 'holes set in a wooden horse' (Theaet.), but instruments of the mind with which they are organically connected. There is no use of them without some use of words&mdash;some natural or latent logic&mdash;some previous experience or observation. Sensation, like all other mental processes, is complex and relative, though apparently simple. The senses mutually confirm and support one another; it is hard to say how much our impressions of hearing may be affected by those of sight, or how far our impressions of sight may be corrected by the touch, especially in infancy. The confirmation of them by one another cannot of course be given by any one of them.</p></div> </div>
