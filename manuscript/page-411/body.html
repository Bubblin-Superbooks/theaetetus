<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: I see, Theaetetus, that your fear has disappeared, and that you are beginning to despise me.</p><p>THEAETETUS: What makes you say so?</p><p>SOCRATES: You think, if I am not mistaken, that your 'truly false' is safe from censure, and that I shall never ask whether there can be a swift which is slow, or a heavy which is light, or any other self-contradictory thing, which works, not according to its own nature, but according to that of its opposite. But I will not insist upon this, for I do not wish needlessly to discourage you. And so you are satisfied that false opinion is heterodoxy, or the thought of something else?</p></div> </div>
