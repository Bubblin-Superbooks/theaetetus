<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For example, I may see a man who has eyes, nose, and mouth;&mdash;that will not distinguish him from any other man. Or he may have a snub-nose and prominent eyes;&mdash;that will not distinguish him from myself and you and others who are like me. But when I see a certain kind of snub-nosedness, then I recognize Theaetetus. And having this sign of difference, I have knowledge. But have I knowledge or opinion of this difference; if I have only opinion I have not knowledge; if I have knowledge we assume a disputed term; for knowledge will have to be defined as right opinion with knowledge of difference.</p><p>And so, Theaetetus, knowledge is neither perception nor true opinion, nor yet definition accompanying true opinion. And I have shown that the children of your brain are not worth rearing.</p></div> </div>
