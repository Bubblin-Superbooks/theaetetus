<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>THEAETETUS: That is a distinction, Socrates, which I have heard made by some one else, but I had forgotten it. He said that true opinion, combined with reason, was knowledge, but that the opinion which had no reason was out of the sphere of knowledge; and that things of which there is no rational account are not knowable&mdash;such was the singular expression which he used&mdash;and that things which have a reason or explanation are knowable.</p><p>SOCRATES: Excellent; but then, how did he distinguish between things which are and are not 'knowable'? I wish that you would repeat to me what he said, and then I shall know whether you and I have heard the same tale.</p></div> </div>
