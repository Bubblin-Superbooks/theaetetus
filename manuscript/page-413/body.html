I speak of what I scarcely understand; but the soul when thinking appears to me to be just talking&mdash;asking questions of herself and answering them, affirming and denying. And when she has arrived at a decision, either gradually or by a sudden impulse, and has at last agreed, and does not doubt, this is called her opinion. I say, then, that to form an opinion is to speak, and opinion is a word spoken,&mdash;I mean, to oneself and in silence, not aloud or to another: What think you?</p><p>THEAETETUS: I agree.</p><p>SOCRATES: Then when any one thinks of one thing as another, he is saying to himself that one thing is another?</p></div> </div>
