<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In seeing or hearing or looking or listening the sensible impression prevails over the conception and the word. In reflection the process is reversed&mdash;the outward object fades away into nothingness, the name or the conception or both together are everything. Language, like number, is intermediate between the two, partaking of the definiteness of the outer and of the universality of the inner world. For logic teaches us that every word is really a universal, and only condescends by the help of position or circumlocution to become the expression of individuals or particulars. And sometimes by using words as symbols we are able to give a 'local habitation and a name' to the infinite and inconceivable.</p><p>Thus we see that no line can be drawn between the powers of sense and of reflection&mdash;they pass imperceptibly into one another.</p></div> </div>
