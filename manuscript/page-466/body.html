<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>THEAETETUS: Very good.</p><p>SOCRATES: And it must have no parts.</p><p>THEAETETUS: Why?</p><p>SOCRATES: Because that which has parts must be a whole of all the parts. Or would you say that a whole, although formed out of the parts, is a single notion different from all the parts?</p><p>THEAETETUS: I should.</p><p>SOCRATES: And would you say that all and the whole are the same, or different?</p><p>THEAETETUS: I am not certain; but, as you like me to answer at once, I shall hazard the reply, that they are different.</p><p>SOCRATES: I approve of your readiness, Theaetetus, but I must take time to think whether I equally approve of your answer.</p></div> </div>
