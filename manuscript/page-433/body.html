Yes, I shall say, with the complacence of one who thinks that he has made a noble discovery.</p><p>THEAETETUS: I see no reason why we should be ashamed of our demonstration, Socrates.</p><p>SOCRATES: He will say: You mean to argue that the man whom we only think of and do not see, cannot be confused with the horse which we do not see or touch, but only think of and do not perceive? That I believe to be my meaning, I shall reply.</p></div> </div>
