<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Let us first approach the river-gods, or patrons of the flux.</p><p>When they speak of motion, must they not include two kinds of motion, change of place and change of nature?&mdash;And all things must be supposed to have both kinds of motion; for if not, the same things would be at rest and in motion, which is contrary to their theory. And did we not say, that all sensations arise thus: they move about between the agent and patient together with a perception, and the patient ceases to be a perceiving power and becomes a percipient, and the agent a quale instead of a quality; but neither has any absolute existence? But now we make the further discovery, that neither white or whiteness, nor any sense or sensation, can be predicated of anything, for they are in a perpetual flux.</p></div> </div>
