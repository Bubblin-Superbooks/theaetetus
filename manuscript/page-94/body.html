<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And thinking is the conversing of the mind with herself, which is carried on in question and answer, until she no longer doubts, but determines and forms an opinion. And false opinion consists in saying to yourself, that one thing is another. But did you ever say to yourself, that good is evil, or evil good? Even in sleep, did you ever imagine that odd was even? Or did any man in his senses ever fancy that an ox was a horse, or that two are one? So that we can never think one thing to be another; for you must not meet me with the verbal quibble that one&mdash;eteron&mdash;is other&mdash;eteron (both 'one' and 'other' in Greek are called 'other'&mdash;eteron). He who has both the two things in his mind, cannot misplace them; and he who has only one of them in his mind, cannot misplace them&mdash;on either supposition transplacement is inconceivable.</p></div> </div>
