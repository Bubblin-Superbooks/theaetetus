<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>THEODORUS: Yes, indeed, Socrates, thousands and tens of thousands, as Homer says, who give me a world of trouble.</p><p>SOCRATES: Well, but are we to assert that what you think is true to you and false to the ten thousand others?</p><p>THEODORUS: No other inference seems to be possible.</p><p>SOCRATES: And how about Protagoras himself? If neither he nor the multitude thought, as indeed they do not think, that man is the measure of all things, must it not follow that the truth of which Protagoras wrote would be true to no one? But if you suppose that he himself thought this, and that the multitude does not agree with him, you must begin by allowing that in whatever proportion the many are more than one, in that proportion his truth is more untrue than true.</p></div> </div>
