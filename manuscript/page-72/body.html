<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'On the condition of not exceeding a single fall, I consent.'</p><p>Socrates now resumes the argument. As he is very desirous of doing justice to Protagoras, he insists on citing his own words,&mdash;'What appears to each man is to him.' And how, asks Socrates, are these words reconcileable with the fact that all mankind are agreed in thinking themselves wiser than others in some respects, and inferior to them in others? In the hour of danger they are ready to fall down and worship any one who is their superior in wisdom as if he were a god. And the world is full of men who are asking to be taught and willing to be ruled, and of other men who are willing to rule and teach them. All which implies that men do judge of one another's impressions, and think some wise and others foolish. How will Protagoras answer this argument? For he cannot say that no one deems another ignorant or mistaken.</p></div> </div>
