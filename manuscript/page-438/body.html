The case would be different if I were a true hero of dialectic: and O that such an one were present! for he would have told us to avoid the use of these terms; at the same time he would not have spared in you and me the faults which I have noted. But, seeing that we are no great wits, shall I venture to say what knowing is? for I think that the attempt may be worth making.</p><p>THEAETETUS: Then by all means venture, and no one shall find fault with you for using the forbidden terms.</p></div> </div>
