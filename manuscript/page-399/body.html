<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>SOCRATES: Then perception, Theaetetus, can never be the same as knowledge or science?</p><p>THEAETETUS: Clearly not, Socrates; and knowledge has now been most distinctly proved to be different from perception.</p><p>SOCRATES: But the original aim of our discussion was to find out rather what knowledge is than what it is not; at the same time we have made some progress, for we no longer seek for knowledge in perception at all, but in that other process, however called, in which the mind is alone and engaged with being.</p><p>THEAETETUS: You mean, Socrates, if I am not mistaken, what is called thinking or opining.</p><p>SOCRATES: You conceive truly. And now, my friend, please to begin again at this point; and having wiped out of your memory all that has preceded, see if you have arrived at any clearer view, and once more say what is knowledge.</p></div> </div>
