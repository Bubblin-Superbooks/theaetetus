I believe that he had seen him a little before his own death, when Theaetetus was a youth, and he had a memorable conversation with him, which he repeated to me when I came to Athens; he was full of admiration of his genius, and said that he would most certainly be a great man, if he lived.</p><p>TERPSION: The prophecy has certainly been fulfilled; but what was the conversation? can you tell me?</p></div> </div>
