<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Not that any one ever made another think truly, who previously thought falsely. For no one can think what is not, or, think anything different from that which he feels; and this is always true. But as the inferior habit of mind has thoughts of kindred nature, so I conceive that a good mind causes men to have good thoughts; and these which the inexperienced call true, I maintain to be only better, and not truer than others. And, O my dear Socrates, I do not call wise men tadpoles: far from it; I say that they are the physicians of the human body, and the husbandmen of plants&mdash;for the husbandmen also take away the evil and disordered sensations of plants, and infuse into them good and healthy sensations&mdash;aye and true ones; and the wise and good rhetoricians make the good instead of the evil to seem just to states;</p></div> </div>
