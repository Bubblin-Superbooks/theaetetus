'Consciousness' is the most treacherous word which is employed in the study of the mind, for it is used in many senses, and has rarely, if ever, been minutely analyzed.

It is a kind of attention which we pay to ourselves, and is intermittent rather than continuous. Its sphere has been exaggerated.</p></div> </div>
